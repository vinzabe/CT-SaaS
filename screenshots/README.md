## Tips for Good Screenshots

1. Use a clean browser window (no bookmarks bar, extensions)
2. Use demo data that looks realistic
3. Capture at 2x resolution if possible (Retina)
4. Crop out browser chrome if desired
5. Consider using a tool like [CleanShot](https://cleanshot.com/) or [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/)
